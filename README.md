# cloud-deploy

**Manifest-driven multi-cloud deployment tool**

`cloud-deploy` is a command-line tool that simplifies deploying containerized applications to multiple cloud providers using a single declarative manifest file. Think of it as "docker-compose for cloud deployments."

## Features

- üìù **Declarative Configuration** - Define your entire deployment in a single YAML manifest
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Multi-Cloud Support** - Deploy to AWS, GCP, Azure, and OCI with the same tool
- üöÄ **Fully Automated** - Creates applications, environments, and deploys via cloud APIs - no console needed
- üîÑ **Idempotent** - Run the same command repeatedly safely
- üì¶ **Docker Support** - Native support for containerized applications
- üìä **Built-in Monitoring** - CloudWatch metrics, enhanced health reporting, and log streaming (AWS)

## Status

üöÄ **Active Development** - AWS and GCP providers implemented

**Supported Providers:**
- [x] AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- [x] Google Cloud Run
- [ ] Azure Container Instances
- [ ] Oracle Cloud Container Instances

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jvreagan/cloud-deploy
cd cloud-deploy

# Build from source
go build -o cloud-deploy cmd/cloud-deploy/main.go

# Or install directly
go install github.com/jvreagan/cloud-deploy/cmd/cloud-deploy@latest
```

## Quick Start

1. Create a deployment manifest (`deploy-manifest.yaml`):

```yaml
version: "1.0"

provider:
  name: aws
  region: us-east-2

application:
  name: my-app
  description: "My Application"
  
environment:
  name: my-app-env
  cname: my-app  # Creates: my-app.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com
  
deployment:
  platform: docker
  solution_stack: "64bit Amazon Linux 2023 v4.7.2 running Docker"
  source:
    type: local
    path: "."
  
instance:
  type: t3.micro
  environment_type: SingleInstance
  
health_check:
  type: enhanced
  path: /health

# Optional: Enable CloudWatch monitoring
monitoring:
  enhanced_health: true
  cloudwatch_metrics: true
```

2. Deploy your application:

```bash
cloud-deploy -command deploy -manifest deploy-manifest.yaml
```

3. Check deployment status:

```bash
cloud-deploy -command status -manifest deploy-manifest.yaml
```

4. Stop when not in use (preserves application for fast restart):

```bash
cloud-deploy -command stop -manifest deploy-manifest.yaml
```

5. Destroy completely when done:

```bash
cloud-deploy -command destroy -manifest deploy-manifest.yaml
```

### GCP-Specific Fields

When using `provider.name: gcp`, these additional fields are required or available:

**Required:**
- `provider.project_id` - Your GCP project ID (cloud-deploy will create if it doesn't exist)
- `provider.billing_account_id` - Your GCP billing account ID (format: XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX)
- `provider.credentials.service_account_key_path` - Path to service account JSON key file
  - OR `provider.credentials.service_account_key_json` - Service account JSON content

**Optional:**
- `provider.public_access` - Make Cloud Run service publicly accessible (default: true)
- `provider.organization_id` - Organization ID (if creating project under an organization)
- `cloud_run.cpu` - CPU allocation: "1", "2", "4" (default: "1")
- `cloud_run.memory` - Memory: "256Mi", "512Mi", "1Gi", "2Gi", "4Gi" (default: "512Mi")
- `cloud_run.max_concurrency` - Max concurrent requests per container (default: 80)
- `cloud_run.min_instances` - Minimum instances (0 = scale to zero, default: 0)
- `cloud_run.max_instances` - Maximum instances (default: 100)
- `cloud_run.timeout_seconds` - Request timeout in seconds (default: 300, max: 3600)
- `monitoring.cloudwatch_logs` - Cloud Logging configuration (same format as AWS)

## Authentication

### AWS

Use AWS credentials for Elastic Beanstalk deployments. Credentials can be provided in three ways (in order of preference):

1. **AWS CLI credentials** (recommended)
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

2. **Environment variables**
   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
   ```

3. **Manifest file** (works but not recommended for production)
   ```yaml
   provider:
     name: aws
     credentials:
       access_key_id: YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
       secret_access_key: YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
   ```

   See `examples/aws-with-credentials.yaml` for a complete example.

   **Security Warning**: Never commit files with real credentials to version control!

### GCP

**No gcloud CLI required!** cloud-deploy is completely self-sufficient for GCP deployments.

#### Step 1: Create a Service Account

1. Go to [GCP Service Accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)
2. Click **Create Service Account**
3. Give it a name (e.g., "cloud-deploy-admin")
4. Grant these roles:
   - **Owner** (simplest, gives all permissions)
   - OR for more granular control:
     - **Project Creator** (to create projects)
     - **Billing Account User** (to link billing)
     - **Service Usage Admin** (to enable APIs)
     - **Cloud Run Admin** (to deploy services)
     - **Cloud Build Editor** (to build images)
     - **Storage Admin** (to upload source code)
5. Click **Done**, then click the service account
6. Go to **Keys** tab ‚Üí **Add Key** ‚Üí **Create new key** ‚Üí **JSON**
7. Download the JSON key file and save it securely

#### Step 2: Get Your Billing Account ID

1. Go to [GCP Billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing)
2. Copy your billing account ID (format: `XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX`)

#### Step 3: Configure Manifest

That's it! Everything else is in the manifest:

```yaml
provider:
  name: gcp
  region: us-central1

  # cloud-deploy will create this project automatically
  project_id: my-new-project

  # Your billing account ID
  billing_account_id: XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX

  # Path to the service account key you downloaded
  credentials:
    service_account_key_path: "/path/to/service-account-key.json"

  # Optional: Make service public (default: true)
  public_access: true
```

#### What cloud-deploy Does Automatically

When you run `cloud-deploy -command deploy`:

1. ‚úÖ Creates the GCP project (if it doesn't exist) with polling until complete
2. ‚úÖ Links your billing account
3. ‚úÖ Enables all required APIs (Cloud Build, Cloud Run, Storage, etc.) with polling
4. ‚úÖ Builds your Docker image using Cloud Build
5. ‚úÖ Deploys to Cloud Run with resource limits and scaling configuration
6. ‚úÖ Configures public access
7. ‚úÖ Sets up Cloud Logging (if enabled)
8. ‚úÖ Waits for service to be ready before returning

## Commands

- **deploy** - Create or update a deployment
- **stop** - Stop the environment/service but preserve the application and versions for fast restart
- **destroy** - Remove a deployment completely (application, environment, and versions)
- **status** - Check deployment status

## Why cloud-deploy?

**Problem:** Each cloud provider has different tools and workflows for deployment:
- AWS: EB CLI, CloudFormation, or console
- GCP: gcloud, Cloud Console
- Azure: az CLI, ARM templates
- Multiple commands required even for simple deployments

**Solution:** One tool, one manifest, any cloud

```bash
# Same command works for AWS, GCP, Azure, OCI
cloud-deploy -command deploy
```

## Comparison

| Tool | Multi-Cloud | Declarative | Docker Support | Learning Curve |
|------|-------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| cloud-deploy | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Low |
| Terraform | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ö†Ô∏è | High |
| EB CLI | ‚ùå (AWS only) | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | Medium |
| gcloud | ‚ùå (GCP only) | ‚ö†Ô∏è | ‚úÖ | Medium |

## Development

```bash
# Run tests
go test ./...

# Build
go build -o cloud-deploy cmd/cloud-deploy/main.go

# Run locally
./cloud-deploy -command deploy -manifest examples/aws-simple.yaml

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains several deployment manifests:

- `aws-simple.yaml` - Minimal AWS deployment (uses default credentials)
- `aws-loadbalanced.yaml` - AWS with load balancer configuration
- `aws-with-credentials.yaml` - AWS with explicit credentials in manifest
- `aws-monitoring.yaml` - AWS with enhanced health reporting and CloudWatch monitoring
- `gcp-example.yaml` - Google Cloud Run deployment
- `deploy-manifest.example.yaml` - Complete reference with all options
