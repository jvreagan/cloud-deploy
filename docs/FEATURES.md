## What is cloud-deploy?

**cloud-deploy** is a manifest-driven, multi-cloud deployment tool that simplifies deploying containerized applications to major cloud providers using a single, declarative YAML configuration.

### The Problem It Solves

**Before cloud-deploy**:
```bash
# AWS deployment
eb init
eb create my-environment
eb deploy
eb setenv VAR1=value VAR2=value
# ... multiple commands, complex setup

# GCP deployment
gcloud projects create my-project
gcloud billing accounts projects link
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/my-project/my-app
gcloud run deploy --image gcr.io/my-project/my-app
# ... many manual steps, CLI tools required

# Different commands, different workflows, different tools
```

**With cloud-deploy**:
```bash
# Any provider (AWS, GCP, Azure, OCI)
cloud-deploy -command deploy -manifest manifest.yaml

# One command, one manifest, any cloud
```

### Think of it as...

- **"docker-compose for cloud deployments"** - Declarative configuration for cloud infrastructure
- **"kubectl for multiple clouds"** - One tool to deploy anywhere
- **"Infrastructure as Config"** - Not full IaC like Terraform, but focused on application deployment

## Core Philosophy

### 1. Declarative Configuration

Everything is defined in a single YAML manifest:

```yaml
version: "1.0"

provider:
  name: aws
  region: us-east-2

application:
  name: my-app

environment:
  name: my-app-prod

deployment:
  platform: docker
  source:
    type: local
    path: "."

# Configuration, not code
```

You declare **what** you want, not **how** to achieve it.

### 2. Multi-Cloud Abstraction

Same manifest structure works across providers:

```yaml
# AWS Elastic Beanstalk
provider:
  name: aws
  region: us-east-2

# Google Cloud Run
provider:
  name: gcp
  region: us-central1
  project_id: my-project
  billing_account_id: XXXXXX

# Azure (coming soon)
provider:
  name: azure
  region: eastus

# Oracle Cloud (coming soon)
provider:
  name: oci
  region: us-phoenix-1
```

Change the provider block, keep everything else.

### 3. Zero Configuration Setup

**AWS**: No manual setup required
- Automatically creates applications
- Automatically creates environments
- Automatically uploads source code
- Auto-detects solution stacks

**GCP**: Completely self-sufficient
- Automatically creates projects
- Automatically links billing
- Automatically enables APIs
- Automatically builds containers

No console clicking, no CLI tools required (except cloud-deploy itself).

### 4. Production-Ready Features

Not just deployment - includes:
- ‚úÖ Monitoring and logging
- ‚úÖ Health checks
- ‚úÖ Auto-scaling
- ‚úÖ Environment variables
- ‚úÖ IAM integration
- ‚úÖ Resource tagging
- ‚úÖ Rolling deployments
- ‚úÖ Zero-downtime updates

## Key Features

### üöÄ Deployment Features

#### Automatic Resource Creation

**AWS**:
- Creates Elastic Beanstalk applications
- Creates environments (single-instance or load-balanced)
- Creates S3 buckets for application versions
- Uploads and versions application code
- Configures EC2 instances, security groups, load balancers

**GCP**:
- Creates GCP projects (if they don't exist)
- Links billing accounts to projects
- Enables required APIs (Cloud Build, Cloud Run, Storage, etc.)
- Creates Cloud Storage buckets
- Builds container images with Cloud Build
- Deploys to Cloud Run with auto-scaling

#### Solution Stack Auto-Detection (AWS)

Don't know which solution stack to use? cloud-deploy auto-detects:

```yaml
deployment:
  platform: docker  # cloud-deploy picks the latest Docker stack on Amazon Linux 2023
```

Automatically selects the latest stable stack for your platform.

#### Intelligent Polling

All long-running operations poll with proper timeouts:

**AWS**:
- Environment creation/updates (15-minute timeout)
- Environment termination (10-minute timeout)
- Real-time status updates

**GCP**:
- Project creation (3-minute timeout)
- API enablement (5-minute timeout per API)
- Service deployment (10-minute timeout)
- Detailed status messages at each stage

No more wondering if something is stuck or just slow.

#### Multiple Deployment Strategies

**AWS**:
- **SingleInstance**: One EC2 instance (dev/test)
- **LoadBalanced**: Auto-scaling with load balancer (production)
- Rolling deployments with zero downtime

**GCP**:
- **Serverless**: Cloud Run auto-scales from 0 to N
- **Always-On**: Keep minimum instances warm
- **Traffic Splitting**: Built into Cloud Run (via console)

### üìä Monitoring & Logging

#### AWS CloudWatch Integration

```yaml
monitoring:
  # Enhanced health reporting
  enhanced_health: true

  # Custom metrics collection
  cloudwatch_metrics: true

  # Log streaming
  cloudwatch_logs:
    enabled: true
    retention_days: 30
    stream_logs: true
```

**Metrics Provided**:
- Request counts (2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx)
- Latency percentiles (p50, p75, p90, p95, p99)
- Environment health status
- Instance health
- Auto-scaling metrics

**Logs Streamed**:
- Application stdout/stderr
- Docker container logs
- Elastic Beanstalk platform logs
- Web server access logs

#### GCP Cloud Logging Integration

```yaml
monitoring:
  cloudwatch_logs:  # Same config structure as AWS
    enabled: true
    retention_days: 7
    stream_logs: true
```

**Automatically Logs**:
- HTTP request logs (method, path, status, latency)
- Application stdout/stderr
- Container lifecycle events
- Cold start events
- Error traces

**Provides Direct Links** to:
- Cloud Console log viewer
- gcloud command to view logs
- Log retention configuration

### üîê Security Features

#### IAM Integration (AWS)

```yaml
iam:
  instance_profile: my-ec2-instance-profile
  service_role: aws-elasticbeanstalk-service-role
```

Your application can access AWS services without hardcoded credentials.

#### Service Account Authentication (GCP)

```yaml
provider:
  credentials:
    service_account_key_path: "/path/to/key.json"
```

Secure authentication using service account credentials.

#### Public/Private Access Control (GCP)

```yaml
provider:
  public_access: true   # Public internet access
  # or
  public_access: false  # Requires IAM authentication
```

Control who can access your services.

#### Environment Variable Management

```yaml
environment_variables:
  NODE_ENV: production
  DATABASE_URL: ${DATABASE_URL}  # From environment
  API_KEY: ${SECRET_API_KEY}     # Injected at deploy time
```

Never commit secrets - use environment variable substitution.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Resource Configuration

#### AWS Instance Configuration

```yaml
instance:
  type: t3.micro                    # EC2 instance type
  environment_type: SingleInstance  # or LoadBalanced

health_check:
  type: enhanced                    # basic or enhanced
  path: /health                     # Health check endpoint
```

#### GCP Cloud Run Configuration

```yaml
cloud_run:
  cpu: "1"                          # CPU cores: 1, 2, 4
  memory: "512Mi"                   # Memory: 256Mi to 4Gi
  max_concurrency: 80               # Requests per container
  min_instances: 0                  # Scale to zero
  max_instances: 100                # Max scale out
  timeout_seconds: 300              # Request timeout
```

Fine-grained control over compute resources.

### üîÑ Environment Management

#### Create, Update, Deploy

```bash
# Create or update deployment
cloud-deploy -command deploy -manifest manifest.yaml
```

- **First run**: Creates everything (application, environment, resources)
- **Subsequent runs**: Updates existing deployment
- **Idempotent**: Safe to run multiple times

#### Stop Without Destroying

```bash
# Stop to save costs, preserves everything for fast restart
cloud-deploy -command stop -manifest manifest.yaml
```

**AWS**: Terminates environment but keeps application and versions
**GCP**: Deletes service but keeps container images

Resume later with `deploy` command - much faster than creating from scratch.

#### Complete Destruction

```bash
# Remove everything
cloud-deploy -command destroy -manifest manifest.yaml
```

**AWS**: Terminates environment (application preserved)
**GCP**: Deletes Cloud Run service

#### Status Checking

```bash
# Get deployment status
cloud-deploy -command status -manifest manifest.yaml
```

Returns:
- Application name
- Environment name
- Current status (Ready, Updating, Deploying, etc.)
- Health status (Healthy, Unhealthy, Unknown)
- Public URL
- Last update time

### üè∑Ô∏è Resource Tagging

```yaml
tags:
  Environment: production
  Project: myapp
  Team: backend
  CostCenter: engineering
  ManagedBy: cloud-deploy
```

**AWS**: Applied to all resources (EC2, load balancers, S3, etc.)
- Visible in AWS Console
- Used for cost allocation
- Searchable in Cost Explorer

**GCP**: Applied to projects and services
- Visible in Cloud Console
- Used for billing reports
- Filterable in resource lists

## Provider Comparison

### AWS Elastic Beanstalk vs GCP Cloud Run

| Feature | AWS Elastic Beanstalk | GCP Cloud Run |
|---------|----------------------|---------------|
| **Compute Model** | EC2 instances (VMs) | Containers (serverless) |
| **Scaling** | Auto-scaling groups (min-max instances) | Auto-scale 0-N containers |
| **Cold Starts** | No (instances always running) | Yes (if min_instances: 0) |
| **Cost Model** | Pay for EC2 instances 24/7 | Pay per request + instance time |
| **Load Balancing** | Application Load Balancer | Built-in (automatic) |
| **Health Checks** | Configurable (basic/enhanced) | Automatic |
| **HTTPS** | Requires certificate setup | Automatic (free) |
| **Best For** | Traditional apps, VMs needed, consistent load | Microservices, APIs, variable/spiky traffic |

### Cost Comparison (Approximate)

**Development Environment** (minimal traffic):

| Provider | Configuration | Monthly Cost |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| AWS | t3.micro (SingleInstance) | ~$8-12 |
| GCP | Scale to zero (min_instances: 0) | < $1 |

**Production Environment** (moderate traffic):

| Provider | Configuration | Monthly Cost |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| AWS | t3.small (LoadBalanced, 2-4 instances) | ~$50-100 |
| GCP | 2 min instances, scale to 50 max | ~$30-80 |

**Production Environment** (high traffic):

| Provider | Configuration | Monthly Cost |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| AWS | t3.medium (LoadBalanced, 4-10 instances) | ~$200-500 |
| GCP | 5 min instances, scale to 500 max | ~$150-400 |

*Estimates include compute only, not data transfer or storage*

### When to Use Each Provider

**Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk when**:
- ‚úÖ You need persistent instances (WebSockets, background workers)
- ‚úÖ Your app requires local disk storage
- ‚úÖ You need consistent, predictable latency (no cold starts)
- ‚úÖ You're already using AWS services (RDS, ElastiCache, etc.)
- ‚úÖ You need fine-grained control over infrastructure

**Use GCP Cloud Run when**:
- ‚úÖ You have variable or spiky traffic (auto-scales better)
- ‚úÖ You want to minimize costs (scale to zero when idle)
- ‚úÖ You're building stateless microservices or APIs
- ‚úÖ You want fastest time-to-deployment (fully managed)
- ‚úÖ You don't need persistent local storage

## Deployment Lifecycle

### 1. Initial Deployment

```bash
cloud-deploy -command deploy -manifest manifest.yaml
```

**What happens**:

**AWS**:
1. ‚úÖ Creates Elastic Beanstalk application (if doesn't exist)
2. ‚úÖ Auto-detects solution stack (if not specified)
3. ‚úÖ Creates S3 bucket for versions
4. ‚úÖ Zips source code
5. ‚úÖ Uploads to S3
6. ‚úÖ Creates application version
7. ‚úÖ Creates environment (EC2, load balancer, security groups)
8. ‚úÖ Deploys application
9. ‚úÖ Configures health checks and monitoring
10. ‚úÖ Waits for environment to be ready (polls every 10s)
11. ‚úÖ Returns public URL

**GCP**:
1. ‚úÖ Creates project (if doesn't exist, polls until ready)
2. ‚úÖ Links billing account
3. ‚úÖ Enables APIs (Cloud Build, Run, Storage - polls each)
4. ‚úÖ Creates storage bucket
5. ‚úÖ Creates tarball of source
6. ‚úÖ Uploads to Cloud Storage
7. ‚úÖ Triggers Cloud Build (builds Docker image)
8. ‚úÖ Waits for build to complete (polls until success)
9. ‚úÖ Creates Cloud Run service with resource config
10. ‚úÖ Configures public access (if enabled)
11. ‚úÖ Configures Cloud Logging (if enabled)
12. ‚úÖ Waits for service to be ready (polls until healthy)
13. ‚úÖ Returns public URL

**Time**: 5-15 minutes (first deployment)

### 2. Update Deployment

```bash
cloud-deploy -command deploy -manifest manifest.yaml
```

**What happens**:

**AWS**:
1. ‚úÖ Detects existing environment
2. ‚úÖ Creates new application version

4. ‚úÖ Gradually shifts traffic to new revision
5. ‚úÖ Waits for service to be ready
6. ‚úÖ Returns URL

**Time**: 3-8 minutes (updates are faster)

### 3. Stop Deployment

```bash
cloud-deploy -command stop -manifest manifest.yaml
```

**AWS**:
- Terminates environment (EC2 instances, load balancer)
- Preserves application and versions in S3
- Next deploy is much faster (doesn't create from scratch)

**GCP**:
- Deletes Cloud Run service
- Preserves container images in GCR
- Next deploy is much faster (doesn't rebuild)

**Time**: 3-5 minutes

### 4. Destroy Deployment

```bash
cloud-deploy -command destroy -manifest manifest.yaml
```

**AWS**:
- Terminates environment completely
- Application definition preserved (not deleted)

**GCP**:
- Deletes Cloud Run service
- Project, storage, and images remain

**Time**: 3-5 minutes

### 5. Check Status
